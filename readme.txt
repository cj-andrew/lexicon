# Lexicon - a "design challenge weekend" theme

Lexicon is a child theme for writers and bloggers, and it is based on the Saga theme by Justin Tadlock:  [Saga](http://themehybrid.com/themes/saga). 

The Lexicon child theme was created as part of the WordPress Theme Review Team's "Design Challenge" weekend event, held on 13th to 14th December 2014. 

The aim of this child theme is to provide a clean base to inspire creative writing. 

No extra templates or custom features have been included in this child theme. Instead, Saga's existing features were used to realise Lexicon's design goals. 

Many thanks to the kind Team Review Team facilitators for hosting a successful design challenge weekend on 12 - 14 Dec 2014, and helping us all out with helpful critique and recommendations.


Special thanks go to [Tammie Lister](https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed), [Mel Choyce](https://profiles.wordpress.org/melchoyce) and [Justin Tadlock] (https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady), for looking in Lexicon's design solution, and providing invaluable direction. They rock!


## Usage notes

Just like the Saga parent theme, Lexicon makes use of standard WordPress features. Very little instruction is required to use it. This allows you to focus on your creative writing.

A few things to note, however:

* Featured images are only displayed if they are at minimum 1100px in width and 500px in height.  This is to maintain an aesthetic consistency throughout the theme.

* Inputting a social profile link in the Primary menu will automatically display an icon for the particular social network on the front end.


## Recommended plugins

The [Subtitles plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles) is an integral part of this theme's design, and is recommended.


## Professional Support

Since Lexicon is based on the Saga theme, you can access the support forums at [Theme Hybrid](http://themehybrid.com/support), to get feature support. There, you can get support for all Justin Tadlock's plugins and themes for a community of 40,000+ users (and growing).
