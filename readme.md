# Lexicon Theme - "Design Challenge Weekend" Version

Lexicon is a child theme for writers and bloggers, and it is based on the Saga parent theme.  It was created as part of the WordPress.org Design Challenge weekend event, held on 13th to 14th December 2014. The aim of this child theme is to provide an alternative design style, based on Saga's existing layout.

For this reason, no custom templates were created for this version. In addition, Saga's existing features were used to realise Lexicon's design objectives. Many thanks to the kind Team Review Team facilitators for hosting the design challenge weekend, and helping us all out with helpful critique and recommendations.

Special thanks go to Tammie Lister (@karmatosed), Mel Choyce (@melchoyce) and Justin Tadlock (@greenshady) for looking in on the design solution offered by Lexicon, and offering invaluable direction. They rock!
