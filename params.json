  "body": "# Lexicon - a \"design challenge weekend\" theme\r\n\r\nLexicon is a child theme for writers and bloggers, and it is based on the Saga theme by Justin Tadlock:  [Saga](http://themehybrid.com/themes/saga). \r\n\r\nThe Lexicon child theme was created as part of the WordPress Theme Review Team's \"Design Challenge\" weekend event, held on 13th to 14th December 2014. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this child theme is to provide a clean base to inspire creative writing. \r\n\r\nNo extra templates or custom features have been included in this child theme. Instead, Saga's existing features were used to realise Lexicon's design goals. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to the kind Team Review Team facilitators for hosting a successful design challenge weekend on 12 - 14 Dec 2014, and helping us all out with helpful critique and recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks go to [Tammie Lister](https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed), [Mel Choyce](https://profiles.wordpress.org/melchoyce) and [Justin Tadlock] (https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady), for looking in Lexicon's design solution, and providing invaluable direction. They rock!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage notes\r\n\r\nJust like the Saga parent theme, Lexicon makes use of standard WordPress features. Very little instruction is required to use it. This allows you to focus on your creative writing.\r\n\r\nA few things to note, however:\r\n\r\n* Featured images are only displayed if they are at minimum 1100px in width and 500px in height.  This is to maintain an aesthetic consistency throughout the theme.\r\n\r\n* Entering a social profile link in the Primary menu will automatically display an icon for that particular social network, on the front end.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Recommended plugins\r\n\r\nThe [Subtitles plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles) is an integral part of this theme's design, and is recommended, but not compulsory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Professional Support\r\n\r\nLexicon is a derivative of the Saga theme. To get support for Saga (this theme's parent), you can access the forums over at [Theme Hybrid](http://themehybrid.com/support). There, you can get support for all Justin Tadlock's plugins and themes for a community of 40,000+ users (and growing).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, for any questions directly related to the Lexicon theme, start from the [WordPress Support Forums] (https://wordpress.org/support/forum/themes-and-templates). You may also contact me as `@wpstudio5` on Slack or Twitter.\r\n\r\n## Copyright and License\r\n\r\nThe following are not included with Lexicon, but they are external resources linked to from within the theme.\r\n\r\n* [Playfair Display Font](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display) by Claus Eggers SÃ¸rensen - Licensed under the [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).\r\n* [Lato Font](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato) by Lukasz Dziedzic - Licensed under the [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).\r\n\r\nThe following resources are included within the Lexicon theme package.\r\n\r\n* [Hybrid Core Framework](http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core) by Justin Tadlock - Licensed under the [GPL, version 2 or later](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\r\n* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy - Licensed under the [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).\r\n* [Theme Mediaelement](https://github.com/justintadlock/theme-mediaelement) by John Dyer, Justin Tadlock - Licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n* [Image used in screenshot](https://unsplash.com/photos/mk7D-4UCfmg/download) by [Florian Klauer](https://unsplash.com) - Licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n\r\nAll other resources and theme elements are licensed under the [GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html), version 2 or later.\r\n\r\n2015 &copy; [CJ Andrew](http://wpstudio5.com/about).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Version 1.0.0\r\n\r\n* Quite new!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
